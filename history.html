                <h2>The Rubik's Cube</h2>
                <p>The Rubik’s Cube was invented on May 19, 1974, by Hungarian professor Ernő Rubik, born on July 13, 1944. In 1979, Rubik entered a partnership with Ideal Toy Company, a collaboration that helped generate widespread international interest in the cube. On June 5, 1982, Budapest, Hungary, hosted the first world championship of speedcubing. Nineteen competitors participated, and American Minh Thai set a new record by achieving a single solve time of 22.95 seconds—then the fastest recorded time. Notably, Jessica Fridrich and Lars Petrus were also present; both later made significant contributions to developing new solving methods and nurturing the speedcubing community.</p>
                <p>Following a decline in popularity after 1983, when official competitions ceased, the advent of the Internet sparked renewed interest. Online communities emerged, giving rise to a new generation of speedcubers. Key figures from the online speedsolving scene—such as Ron van Bruchem, Tyson Mao, Chris Hardwick, and Ton Dennenbroek—sought to create an organization for international competition. Their efforts culminated in championships held in 2003 in Toronto, Ontario, and subsequently in the Netherlands. This revival led to a rapid expansion of organized speedcubing events, with national and international competitions multiplying over the years. Since the inaugural competition in Budapest, nine World Championships have been held on a biennial basis under the auspices of the World Cube Association (WCA).</p>
                <p>In parallel with the sport’s growth, numerous entrepreneurial ventures emerged. Companies such as GANCube, MoYu, YJ, and QiYi have been at the forefront of enhancing cube technology. Their innovations—designed to produce speedcubes with smoother turning and faster solving—have helped transform the Rubik’s Cube from a popular toy into a sophisticated competitive instrument and a lucrative business sector.</p>
                
                <h2>World Cube Assosiation</h2>
                <p>Key figures from the online speedsolving community—such as Ron van Bruchem, Tyson Mao, Chris Hardwick, and Ton Dennenbroek—sought to unite cubers worldwide by establishing formal competitions. In 2003, they organized a championship in Toronto, Ontario, followed later that year by an event in the Netherlands. This revival catalyzed a rapid expansion of organized speedcubing events: from twelve competitions in 2004 and 58 between 2005 and 2006, to over 100 in 2008 and more than 1150 by 2018. Since the inaugural 1982 championship in Budapest, nine additional World Championships have been held on a biennial schedule under the auspices of the World Cube Association (WCA).</p>
                <p>Simultaneously, the surge in speedcubing’s popularity spurred numerous entrepreneurial ventures focused on developing and marketing specialized speedcubes. Companies such as GANCube, MoYu, YJ, and QiYi have been instrumental in advancing cube technology by engineering models that offer smoother turning and faster solve times. This innovation has transformed the Rubik’s Cube from a simple puzzle into both a sophisticated competitive instrument and a lucrative business opportunity.</p>
